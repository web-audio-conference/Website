title: "Browser-Based Collaborative Live Coding With Glicol: A Graph-Oriented Live Coding Language Written In Rust"
abstract: "In this workshop, participants will be invited to try out Glicol, a graph-oriented live coding language written in Rust.  Participants will get familiar with the syntax of Glicol, as well as its browser-based environment developed with WebAssembly, AudioWorklet and SharedArrayBuffer. In the browser-based interface, a new form of interaction in collaborative live coding will be introduced too. After that, participants can brainstorm new features together and learn how to customise the language. In addition, there will be a scheduled live coding performance with Glicol at the conference, and participants of the workshop can choose to join as co-performers."
