title: "Collaborative Live Coding with Glicol Music Programming Language"
abstract: "Glicol is a graph-oriented live coding language developed with Rust, WebAssembly and AudioWorklet. This language can run in its web-based IDE that supports collaborative coding. In this performance, we invite the participants from the Glicol workshop to join the performance virtually. Each performer will be given the opportunity to write at least one musical loop, and the first author will be in charge of when to execute the code. The music style will be improvised experimental/ambient techno."
