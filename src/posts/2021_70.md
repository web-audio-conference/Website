abstract: "Senior software engineer and Microsoft Accessibility MVP. I’ve been fighting and having fun with technology for over thirteen years. My goal? Making technology more accessible every day… and learning, always learning something new.  Specialized in .NET, I am passionate about developing and making applications that improve the daily lives of people like me, we have a different way of accessing information.  Proud husband and father of an adorable six-year-old boy. I love music (I’m a pianist but with the PC keys I don’t have much time left for that hobby), and a lover of literature."
