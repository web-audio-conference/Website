title: "CosmoNote: A Web-based Citizen Science Tool for Annotating Music Performances"
abstract: "CosmoNote is a web-based citizen science tool for annotating musical structures, with a focus on structures created by the performer during expressive musical performance. The software interface enables the superimposition of synchronized discrete and continuous information layers which include note data representations, audio features such as loudness and tempo, and score features such as harmonic tension in a visual and audio environment. The tools provide the means for users to signal performance decisions such as segmentation and prominence using boundaries of varying strengths, regions, comments, and note groupings. User-friendly interaction features have been built in to facilitate ease of annotation; these include the ability to zoom in, listen to, and mark up specific segments of music. The data collected will be used to discover the vocabulary of performed music structures and to aid in the understanding of expressive choices and nuances."
