title: "Antropoloops online music remix tool for education: A Web Audio API Case Study"
abstract: "In this talk we will explain why and how we used modern web technologies, and specifically, the Web Audio API to build a creative digital tool intended to be used in the entry levels of our educational system (primary and secondary education).

We are Rubén Alonso (artist and co-creator of “Antropoloops” project: a creative approach to ethnomusicology, where musical expressions from different cultures and times come into dialogue through electronic music) and Daniel Gómez (musician and software developer).

We are part of a team made up of artists, educators and technicians, that asked ourselves how to combine sound collage, body movement and electronics to celebrate and engage cultural diversity in educational environments.

Over the last three years, in collaboration with Carasso Foundation, we have developed both a methodology and an online remixing tool (https://play.antropoloops.com) that aims to explore the potential of music remixing as a way to work towards cultural inclusion at schools."
