  title: "Geolocation Adaptive Music Player" 
  abstract: "We present a web-based cross-platform adaptive music player that combines music information retrieval (MIR) and audio processing technologies with the interaction capabilities offered by GPS-equipped mobile devices. The application plays back a list of music tracks, which are linked to geographic paths in a map. The music player has two main enhanced features that adjust to the location of the user, namely, adaptable length of the songs and automatic transitions between tracks. Music tracks are represented as data packages containing audio and metadata (descriptive and behavioral) that builds on the concept of Digital Music Object (DMO). This representation, in line with nextgeneration web technologies, allows for flexible production and consumption of novel musical experiences. A content provider assembles a data pack with music, descriptive analysis and action parameters that users can experience and control within the restrictions and templates defined by the provider."
