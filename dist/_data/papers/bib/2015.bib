abstract  = {The audio programming world is extremely prolific in domain-specific languages. Programmers and musicians prefer a custom-tailored environment where their high-level ideas can be better expressed and implemented thanks to specific domain knowledge. In particular, strongly typed functional programming has become an ideal platform for audio programming, thanks to a concise, high-level writing style, high reusability, and ability to avoid mistakes and improve error handling. - How may Web Audio benefit from these ideas? - How may such languages benefit from Web Audio? In this talk, we will use the functional audio programming language Faust as the reference DSL, to discuss a formal theory of interoperable and efficient audio components. Particular emphasis will be made on the use of strong, functional-style type-systems. We will address performance, security, and practical considerations, and reflect on the relationship of such theoretical framework to the actual standard.},

An overture on the state of web audio tools, we will explore using both browser developer tools that take advantage of privileged platform code, and cross-browser drop-in libraries to provide introspection of the state of an audio context and nodes. With these tools, we'll cover common debugging scenarios like audio graph construction, node-to-node signal transformations, signal visualizations, garbage collection, and resource consumption. These tools can help beginners understand a complex new API, save a developer's time debugging, and help browser implementers optimize their platform. Attendees will leave with the knowledge of what tools are out there, workflows for inspecting, fixing, and optimizing a web audio environment, and how to make their own tools for a specific use case.},

abstract  = {The introduction of the Web Audio API has enriched the web landscape enormously. It gives game developers the ability to add precisely timed, high performant sound effects and to create realistic spatialized sound landscapes. For many web developers it is the first time they encounter audio programming which leads to many interesting experiments when the world of web and audio collide. Traditional web developers start to become really interested in audio programming and educate themselves on the topic of synthesizers and audio effects. However, currently there are only few applications that try to create more sophisticates audio production tools in the browser. In this talk I want to show how I used the Web Audio API and other emerging web standards like WebRTC to create a collaborative digital audio workstation.

Similarly, "parallel computers" were locked in research facilities, where only a few musicians ever gained access to, for example, the compute power to convolve hundreds of separate audio streams with spatially- specific room impulse responses. Mobile devices in the hands of audiences can quickly configure themselves into such systems at very affordable (and distributed) cost and little effort, making powerful and expressive spatially distributed musical platforms accessible to anyone today. We describe some software systems and artistic works that have been developed recently to explore some of the spatial audio capabilities of the mobile device browser platform.},

The majority of such listening tests is conducted in controlled environments with selected participants and professional audio equipment. In the last few years, conducting listening tests over the Internet, as so called web-based experiments, has become popular. A recent study has shown that web-based experiments lead to comparable results as laboratory experiments. Until now, it was only possible to implement a limited number of listening test types as web-based experiments because web standards were missing some crucial features, e. g. sample manipulation of audio streams. With the upcoming of the Web Audio API, a much wider range of listening test types can be implemented as new audio processing features have been introduced. This paper demonstrates which new possibilities are enabled by the Web Audio API. To this end, the ITU-R Recommendation BS.1534 (MUSHRA) is taken as an example.},

Sonic source material comes from a database of birdsongs recorded worldwide by volunteer recordists at xeno-canto.org. Sounds from xeno-canto are chosen to match recent, nearby bird sightings submitted by volunteer birders at eBird. The result is a virtual soundscape derived from the sounds of birds currently present in the user's geographical region. Our client-server architecture delegates database queries and archival storage to the server, leaving the client to concentrate on the aesthetic context of sound modification and manipulation. Engineering issues include separation of client versus server concerns and mashups of crowdsourced databases. Aesthetic issues include which tasks are automated server-side, which are user-controlled client-side, and why. Social issues include single user versus multiple user paradigms, artistic soundscape composition versus commercial applications (e.g., games with evolving sound tracks) using public domain sound sources, music as foreground art versus background audio content, and the larger role of sound and music in current society.

abstract  = {Technologies for discovering sounds in large databases can help breaking the boundary between exploration and music performance. In this paper, we present a system for exploring loops from Freesound. Sound files are grouped by their most common repetition periods, so that they can be played in sync. A graph layout algorithm is used to organize sounds in a two-dimensional plane so that loops with similar timbre are spatially close. The result is a system that can be used as a musical instrument: since sounds will always play in sync, the user can freely explore the variety of sounds uploaded by the Freesound community, while continuously producing a rhythmic music stream.},

abstract  = {IEEE 1599 is an international standard originally conceived for music, which aims at providing a comprehensive description of the media contents related to a music piece within a multi-layer and synchronized environment. A number of off-line and stand-alone software prototypes has been realized after its standardization, occurred in 2008. Recently, thanks to some technological advances (e.g. the release of HTML5), the engine of the IEEE 1599 parser has been ported on the Web. Some non-trivial problems have been solved, e.g. the management of multiple simultaneous media streams in a client-server architecture. After providing an overview of the IEEE 1599 standard, this article presents a survey of the recent initiatives regarding audio-driven synchronization over the Web.},

The proposed solution aims at building a web framwork with Web Audio API, giving support to the download of head-related trafer functions (HRTFs) associated with listener's personal profile from a server and the synchronization between the listener's devices. With each playback device and listener, the individual headphone equalization filters will be computed from headphone transfer functions (HpTFs) stored on the server. At server side, we propose to store the HRTFs and HpTFs in spatially oriented format for acoustics (SOFA). At client-side, we propose to convert the data to a new structure (WAV) ensuring a compatible solution with existing Web Audio API implementations. A binaural rendering implementation in JavaScript acting as a proof-of-concept reveals critical issues related to the native implementation in web browsers.},

abstract  = {We introduce in this paper a soundscape simulator called SimScene, designed to be used as an experimental tool to characterize the mental representation of sound environments. The soundscape simulator allows a subject to generate a full sonic environment by sequencing and mixing sound elements , and manipulating their sound level and time positioning. To make the simulation process effective, SimScene has not be designed to manipulate individual parameters of individual sounds, but to specify high-level parameters for whole classes of sounds, organized into a hierarchical semantically structured dataset. To avoid any linguistic bias, a listening oriented interface allows subjects to explore the dataset without any text written help. The entire software is developed in Javascript using the standard Web Audio technology , and is thus fully supported by most modern web browsers. This fact should allow experimenters to adopt a crowdsourcing approach to experimentation in order to assess hypotheses on large populations, and facilitate the development of experimental protocols to investigate the influence of socio-cultural background on soundscape perception.},

abstract  = {Audio quality is very important to the BBC's audience, and unwanted loudness variations reduce the quality of the listeners' experience. Dynamic range control applied by the broadcaster can go some way to avoiding problems but, because the broadcaster cannot take into account each listener's individual environment, needs, or preference, it cannot please everyone all the time. The listening conditions are a significant factor to be taken into account when dynamic range control is applied. The Web Audio API offers the possibility of performing dynamic range control under the control of the listener, tailoring it optimally for their individual situation. We have developed a system that demonstrates that this is achievable in a modern web browser. In it, a compressor is controlled automatically by the environmental noise level measured using the microphone present in most mobile device audio players.},
