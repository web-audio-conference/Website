title: "Collaborative Music Creation and Performance with Soundcool Online"
abstract: "Soundcool Online is a Web Audio re-implementation of the original Max/MSP implementation of Soundcool, a system for collaborative music and audiovisual creation. Soundcool has many educational applications, and because Linux has been adopted in many school systems, we turned to Web Audio to enable Soundcool to run on Linux as well as many other platforms. An additional advantage of Soundcool Online is the elimination of a large download, allowing beginners to try the system more easily. Another advantage is the support for sharing provided by a centralized server, where projects can be stored and accessed by others. A cloud-based server also facilitates collaboration at a distance where multiple users can control the same project. In this scenario, local sound synthesis provides high-quality sound without the large bandwidth requirements of shared audio streams. Experience with Web Audio and latency measurements are reported."
