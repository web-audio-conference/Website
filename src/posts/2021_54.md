title: "EMDM Online Concerts in the Pandemic: Bringing the Live to Live Streaming"
abstract: "To overcome the deficit of live events in 2020 and a lack of feeling of live performance through streaming, a trio of concerts were created using the web as a medium for performance. The first concert was an attempt to infuse live event dynamics into a series of recorded pieces. The second consisted of live performances presented in novel ways to the audience such as 360 degree video and composites of browser based and live-stream media. The third was performed entirely live with 11 isolated performers located in completely separate spaces. 

This talk will cover the novelty of using a website and distributed performance tools as a platform for delivering live performance and reintroducing the audience/performer connection in mediated performance."
