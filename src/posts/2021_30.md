title: "Online Audio Editor in Freesound"
abstract: "Freesound has a huge community dedicated to upload and share sounds online for other users to use those sounds in their productions. In some cases, the sounds will need to be transformed and users will have to go in their devices and edit that sound in order to get the exact version that fits their production the most. In this paper, an audio editor is developed and added into the Freesoud environment in order to have those two steps together in the same workflow. This approach will add a huge value to the Freesound experience and will differentiate it from its competitors. For the development of this editor, different Javascipt and HTML frameworks have been used, like Wavesurfer (based on Web Audio API) or Bootstrap, always trying to keep the interface and functionalities accessible and easy-to-use to a general audience. Finally, two evaluation methods have been developed, the first in order to get some general feedback about the use of the editor and the second one to be sure that all its different functionalities behave as expected. The first evaluation showed the need of a simpler interface and functionalities, which was developed and then tested using the second evaluation approach, showing that all different actions, filters and effects worked as expected."
