title: "immaterial.cloud: Using peer-to-peer technologies for music"
abstract: "immaterial.cloud is an immersive audiovisual installation that explores a possible networked future of peer-to-peer technologies, away from cloud computing. Participants experience the work via two to four smartphones placed in
different locations in a room. As participants walk up to a phone, they see a representation of themselves through data. If the participant gets close enough, the phone triggers a change in the sound of immaterial.cloud and the other phones follow."
