title: "Aerial Glass: A Live Browser and Aerial Silk Performance"
abstract: "Aerial Glass is a real-time performance, delivered through a website, of aerial silk acrobatics composited with a live browser performance of various video clips and audio composition. It uses the NexusHub framework to distribute a live in-browser performance of pre-rendered, transparent video clips, audio files, and web audio effects to everyone else visiting the website. A live physical performance on aerial silks is recorded in front of a green screen and live streamed to the website to be composited with the browser performance. 

We propose a live performance of the work during the Web Audio Conference with performers at LSU, distributed to a worldwide audience through a website."
