title: "Creating Telematic Musical Performances Through Max And The Web With Collab-Hub"
abstract: "This workshop serves as an introduction to building remote/local networked audiovisual performances and pedagogical tools using Collab-Hub, a package for remote collaboration based on Node.js and implemented within Max and as a web-based interface. Collab-Hub is a system built for sharing of data and eliminates the need for collaborators to be aware of their/each othersâ€™ IP address. It has applications in many performance paradigms, including telematic performance, laptop orchestra, mixed ensemble with digital elements, distributed control, net-to-physical interaction, and more."
