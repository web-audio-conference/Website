title: "Bringing sport fans back into the arena with web technology"
abstract: "From it's very beginning the Web Audio conference was a place which showcased systems using web technology to enable remote audience participation. Numerous talks workshops and live performances were dedicated to this topic. But up until recently this was considered to be a nice add-on for live events outside of the Web Audio world. However the current pandemic changed this drastically.

Many events can't be attended in person anymore. This is true for small concerts and conferences but also for usually well attended sports events. In many cases remote participation became the only possible form of participation. For sports events this imposes a special problem since the reactions and chants from the stands are considered to be a part of the experience. Therefore many TV stations choose to play artificial background noise when broadcasting sports events without any onsite spectators.

I would like to present a system which uses web technologies to bring back the voices of sport fans into the arenas. It builds up on common rituals that many fans are used to. It's meant to be as less obtrusive as possible. It works by sending the announcements of the pa announcer to the fans at home. They can respond as they are used to. The responses get recorded as well and sent back. In the arena the players will hear the slightly delayed announcement together with the responses from their fans. The system is very scalable and can be used by as many people as would otherwise be in the stadium."
