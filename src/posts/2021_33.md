title: "Live Coding with Crowdsourced Sounds and A Virtual Agent Companion"
abstract: "This performance combines machine learning algorithms with music information retrieval techniques to retrieve crowdsourced sounds from the online database Freesound.org, which results in a sound-based music style. The use of a virtual companion complements a human live coder in her/his practice. The core themes of legibility, agency and negotiability in performance are researched through the collaboration between the human live coder, the virtual agent and the audience."
