title: "Live Streaming Platform As An Instrument, Experience And Pastime"
abstract: "This paper introduces a design and the implementation of a proof of concept for a sonic cyberspace. The purpose of this is to explore new media, and find potential in our existing technology and infrastructure. The central theme of this cyberspace is collective collaboration, and documenting the process of developing speculative creativity platforms. It is discovered some streaming technology, such as Icecast, is not suitable for more complex use-cases. The paper proposes an appropriation of modern streaming protocols, and discusses the potential of incorporating out-of-band metadata to explore unique applications of this design. The paper discusses how the attitude towards composition transforms when the ability to dominate experience is countered by randomness. Additionally, the design suggests only the creative experience can have no latency as well as a certainty of realness, questioning the relevance of real-time and live streaming for performance and collaboration in music."
