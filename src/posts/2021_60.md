title: "A multitrack reactive music player for the browser"
abstract: "Accompanying systems provide musical accompaniment to a human performer. These systems can adapt to music contextual changes like the tempo or the tonality, which makes them an interesting tool for music students. In this paper I describe a
browser-based multitrack reactive music player. This player enables bringing up automatic accompanying systems to the browser. The player is implemented in TypeScript, using the web audio API and MIDI.js soundfonts."
