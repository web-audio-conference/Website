title: "Creating And Developing Distributed Music Application Using The Soundworks Framework"
abstract: "This workshop will give participants the opportunity to learn the basics of soundworks, a full-stack JavaScript framework for developing distributed and synchronized web-audio applications both in the browser or on embedded hardware. After a short presentation of the framework possibilities, architecture and ecosystem, the workshop will propose a hands-on session around the implementation of a simple application. The proposed application will be designed to focus on a number of key features proposed by the framework, such as the distributed state management and the plug-in systems, in particular through the implementation and usage of a synchronised scheduling system. The workshop will conclude on a discussion and Q&A session."
