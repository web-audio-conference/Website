title: "Composing and Improvising Using Sound Content-Based Descriptive Filtering"
abstract: "The Freesound Player is a digital instrument developed in Max MSP that uses the Freesound API to make requests for as many as 16 sound samples which are filtered based on sound content. Once the samples are returned they are loaded into buffers and can be performed using a MIDI controller and processed in a variety of ways. The filters implemented will be discussed and demonstrated using three music compositions by the authors, along with considerations for composing and improvising using sound content-based descriptive filtering."
