title: "Surfing with Narcissus: Updating the Technology used in Thea Musgrave’s work for Solo Clarinet"
abstract: "Narcissus is a work created in 1987 by Thea Musgrave for clarinet (or flute) and delayed audio that uses a delay box. In order to recreate the piece using modern technology, our research team developed a web application to emulate the functions of the original equipment in Narcissus. The present paper is our report about the experience of recreating Musgrave’s work using web audio and web music APIs."
