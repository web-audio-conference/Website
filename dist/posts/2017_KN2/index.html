As a performer I will draw on a few musical performance scenarios to explore this sonic flânerie, a musicking where our ear is urged to reach across nodes, and which ultimately positions listening as a corporeal and multi-dimensional experience that is continuously being re-shaped by technological, socio-political and cultural concerns.</div>
