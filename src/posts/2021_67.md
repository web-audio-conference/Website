title: "Presentation And Tutorial On WebAudio Modules 2.0, A Standard For Interoperable WebAudio Plug-Ins"
abstract: "In the past, two standards for WebAudio plug-ins existed, with a certain degree of compatibility: WAP (for WebAudio Plugins) and WAM (for WebAudio Modules). Such plugins could be used in different hosts, including a commercial online DAW (AmpedStudio.com), see screenshots at the end of this proposal.  There were some relationships between the two, some authors worked on both projects, and WAMs were a particular case of WAPs, but this was a bit confusing.  All the people involved (Jari Kleimola and Oliver Larkin from WebAudioModules.org, engineers from the online DAW  AmpedStudio.com, Michel Buffa and Shihong Ren, Steven Yi from Csound, FAUST DSL team Stéphane Letz, Yann Orlarey, a small french company 53JS.com) decided to merge and unify their work in early 2020.  Now comes WebAudio Modules 2.0 (aka WAM2.0), the unification of previous standards. it comes in the form of a git repo with a SDK, many examples of plugins written in JavaScript, TypeScript, some using the React framework, some written in FAUST, some in Csound."
