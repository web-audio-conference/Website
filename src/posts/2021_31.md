title: "Play the place: Experiencing architectural spaces using a web-based 3D audio environment"
abstract: "Assessing the acoustics of an architectural space before its physical construction is of interest to architects and structural engineers. In this work, we present a browser-based interactive app enabling sonic interaction in a virtual environment modeled after a small studio architectural design for music ideation and creation made by architects Stephan & Eric Zimmerli, called ‘Studiolo’. We first describe our ideation and design process involving pilot testing in the New Atlantis online environment for a collaborative sound and music experience. We then describe the implementation of the ‘Studiolo’ web app prototype supported by Javascript packages (Tone, Resonance Audio, Three, and Tween) and the Web Audio API. Room acoustics is modeled using the EVERTims framework providing a real-time auralization engine for binaural room impulse response approximation. A critical analysis by one of the architects highlights the importance of multimodal factors, from visual mapping textures and lighting quality to more sensitive and responsive timbres addressing the “tactile dimension” of music creation."
