She holds a PhD in computer science from Harvard University and was a recipient of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. She spent the later parts of her PhD as a visiting research student at the Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms (MILA), where she also currently co-advises students. She publishes in machine learning, human-computer interaction, and music, at conferences such as ICLR, IUI, CHI, and ISMIR. She is currently an editor for the TISMIR journal’s Special issue on AI and Musical Creativity.  She was a judge for the first international AI Song Contest, and is organizing its second edition. As a composer, she wrote for a cappella, mixed ensembles and orchestra. She also wrote for tape and live electronics that was performed on the 40-channel HYDRA loudspeaker orchestra.
