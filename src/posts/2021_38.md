title: "AIrgots: Live Coding Performance"
abstract: "We present a hybrid live coding musical performance using the latest version of Sema, the live coding language design and performance playground for the Web, with a custom Web Audio API signal engine. We explore machine learning, bespoke languages and interfaces as creative material in musical performance. Bernardo, Kiefer and Magnusson will collaborate as an ensemble of three, with networked and synchronized instances of Sema, in a performance which combines elements of improvisation and machine agency."
